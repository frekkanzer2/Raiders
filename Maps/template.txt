THIRD ROW

FIRST ROW: map title
SECOND ROW: blocks mapping - specify initializator sprite ids - each block sprite id will be assigned to map ordered id
		es. 5-8-10 are sprites ids; 1-2-3 will be map ids with 1=5, 2=8 and 3=10
THIRD ROW: specify map ids to create the map - go in a new line to create a new map line - separate each id with "-"
		- use id = 0 to deny block creation in the id position
